    <h1>Terms of Service - Effective April 20 2025</h1>
    <p>By using TranscribeNowUK, you are agreeing to the following terms of service.</p>
      <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>
      <p>TranscribeNowUK offers professional audio and video transcription, copy-typing, and document conversion services. We strive to deliver accurate and timely results based on the information and materials you provide.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Client Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy of Materials:</strong> Clients are responsible for providing clear, legible, and complete materials for transcription or copy-typing. Any errors in the materials submitted will not be the responsibility of TranscribeNowUK.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Clients must ensure timely payment for services rendered. Prices will be confirmed before work begins, and payments are due in full upon receipt of the invoice.</li>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> TranscribeNowUK takes confidentiality seriously and will handle your materials with care. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that any confidential information is securely provided.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Pricing & Payment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> All prices are agreed upon before services begin. Additional charges may apply for services such as rush turnaround, complex formatting, or additional timestamps. The final pricing may vary depending on the legibility of the text or intelligibility of spoken English. TranscribeNowUK reserves the right to determine the applicable pricing structure based on the quality and clarity of the materials provided.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> Payments are ideally released upon each milestone of 30 or 60 minutes of audio transcribed or 5,000 - 10,000 words of copy-typing. Paypal is the only accepted method of payment at this time.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Limits:</strong> TranscribeNowUK does not accept projects exceeding 7,200 minutes of audio or 1,000,000 words of copy-typing as a single project. If you have a large amount of work, please submit as multiple smaller projects.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Revisions & Cancellations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Revisions:</strong> We offer 1 revision for free within 28 days of delivery. Any additional revisions may incur extra charges.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellations:</strong> If you wish to cancel an order, you must notify us within 2 hours of submission. Cancellations after work has begun may be subject to partial payment.</li>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Accuracy & Liability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> We guarantee 99% accuracy only on recordings considered "easily intelligible" and documents that are "easy to read". TranscribeNowUK is not responsible for materials that are difficult to transcribe due to poor audio quality or illegible handwriting, and this may be reflected in pricing.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality:</strong> If TranscribeNowUK provides an initial quote based on the first few minutes of audio or small selection of submitted documents/images, and subsequent portions of the audio or documents/images exhibit a significant decline in quality or intelligibility, we reserve the right to adjust the final price in accordance with our pricing structure for challenging audio and text quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> TranscribeNowUK is not liable for any indirect or consequential damages that arise from the use of our services. Clients are responsible for ensuring that the final product meets their needs and specifications.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

        <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> We use appropriate measures to protect your data but cannot be held responsible for breaches in cases of unforeseen events.</li>
